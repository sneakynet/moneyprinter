# MoneyPrinter

MoneyPrinter is a telephone billing server.  It is not the kind you
are likely to ever run in an organization or business.  Instead,
MoneyPrinter is written from the perspective of a regional phone
company with questionable disdain for its customers.

If you want to ingest a new kind of CDR, open a feature ticket with an
example of the CDR format you want to ingest.
